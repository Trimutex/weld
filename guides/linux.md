# Installing Linux
Now that you have chosen your Linux pieces, its time to assemble them!

## Creating space
If you are dual-booting, you have two options:

### Use a new drive
For this option, make sure you have connected the new drive into the system.

### Use some of the current space
Here, you can shave off extra space from Windows for Linux

## Follow the guide
The guides for Linux are pretty easy to follow along with and will go into much more detail than here.
As such, refer to the distribution's installation guide for this step.

## Boot into Linux
If you have issues getting into your new Linux install, see this section's FAQ.

## Install applications
This is your first go-to method of getting software.
Each distribution has its own application install method.
For a quick start, take a look at your distribution of choice's method below:

### Kubuntu
Features "Muon Discover" as a GUI package manager.

### Mint
Features "Synaptic Package Manager" as a GUI package manager.

### Debian
No GUI package manager here, but uses "apt" through the CLI

### Arch
No GUI package manager here, but uses "pacman" through the CLI

If you can't get the software through your distro's package manager, going to the official website for the software as you normally would on Windows is your next best option.
