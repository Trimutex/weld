# Installation Types

[Section FAQ](faq-type.md)

## Remain on Windows, but have some Linux
For this type, you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux.  
This is not currently planned to be covered in this guide.  
For now, here's Windows's guide for this one: [Guide Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)


## Install Linux, but be able to go back if needed
This type uses a dual boot method.  
Dual booting will show a menu for the user to select Windows or Linux on startup.  
Doing this, you are free to return to Windows whenever you need.


## Throw away Windows, I only want Linux
This type deletes Windows entirely, giving all the space to Linux.

>**Warning: this erases all the data, even the important stuff!**
> Consider starting with a dual boot and then moving the data if you want this.
> You can always reclaim this space later with this method
