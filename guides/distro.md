#### Where's the newer stuff?
There are alternatives for newer packages that have a setup GUI already.
However, these aren't recommended as it is less stable and less user-friendly.


### I want to setup this myself

#### **Debian** - Stable
While the packages will be a little old, it will definitely be stable.
Safer option if you don't want to mess with the system once it's setup.

#### **Arch Linux** - Rolling release (unstable)
This is great for using the newest packages.
Will require lots of tinkering.
