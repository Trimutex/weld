These are typically called display managers.

### [SDDM](https://github.com/sddm/sddm)
A display manager for both X11 and Wayland.

### None
If you want, you can simply not have a login screen!
This means that you will login through the TTY and launch the window manager yourself.

## Window Manager
There are two display server types X11 and Wayland.
They aren't interchangeable for window managers, but can be swapped between in the login screen.
